I created this to grasp a better understanding of building with React and it's creative applications. 

## Resources Used

- [Dev Ed on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClb90NQQcskPUGDIXsQEz5Q) was a huge help! I would try working through it on my own and then reference his tutorials when I would get too stuck to figure it out (in a reasonable amount of time)
- [The official React Docs](https://reactjs.org/)! I have been living on there for about the entirety of building this out.
- [W3school](https://www.w3schools.com/)
- And a TON of Googling!
