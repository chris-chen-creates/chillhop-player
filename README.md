I created this to grasp a better understanding of building with React and it's creative applications. 

I used a few different resources to help figure this out

Dev Ed on Youtube was a huge help! I would try working through it on my own and then reference his videos when I would get too stuck to figure it out (in a reasonable amount of time)
The official React Docs! I have been living on there for about the entirety of building this out.
